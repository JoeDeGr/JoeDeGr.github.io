So... halfway through week three and I'm feeling like I am finally beginning to build momentum. There have been a few hurdles and more than a few boneheaded mistakes, but the more I'm in it, the better I am getting. In hindsight I am definitely glad I did as much of the Bootcamp Prep as I could prior to beginning the course materials, as well as a couple of solo Learn and Grasshopper fundamentals courses. The leg up on concepts and logic has been huge. I am definitely shaking any doubts that Software Engineer might just threequel This Carpenter. 

I read early on that one of the biggest hurdles to making a change in to technology industry is imposter syndrome, a feeling that you do not fit or that you are not qualified for the position, that you are not really that kind of person. Gil Corkingdale writes in the Harvard business review, ” Imposter syndrome can be defined as a collection of feelings of inadequacy that persist despite evident success” (Corkindale, 2019).  As an older convertee I can definitely say that this was something that was of concern to me. After all, I spent years swinging a hammer and running my own business, could I really expect that I'd fit the class of Software Engineer? Even with my successes and experience could I really make the change? Could I be the kind of person that is a software engineer, or would I just be faking it? Well this has caused me to sit back and ruminate on my successes and failures and where these feelings come from. 
It’s easy to place both blame and credit on things like luck or opportunity, especially when you consider the amount of research, we, as Software Engineers, have to do to solve some of our problems. We might look online with a Google search or on a website like Stack Overflow or, work in a co-working environment like We Work and pair or group code, or even use the phone-a-friend technique as I tend to do often here in North West Connecticut where I work from home. Why would I expect to feel like my success is something that wasn’t the result of some outside force? That this is my own doing or that we deserved the rewards.

I can see how in an ever-changing industry keeping up alone can seem an insurmountable task. Thinking about this I kept hearing a college professor I had who used to say to me “Joe, hard work always beats talent when talent doesn’t work hard.” Does that mean that either the talented person or the untalented person are imposters? No. It means that if you work hard you will succeed. We can’t expect to know everything, and as another professor once said to me, “we shouldn’t be certain we know anything.” It is the pursuit of knowledge and the hard work that goes along with it that is important. From that we can derive that we SHOULD be checking our work against others and we SHOULD always be challenging ourselves. we SOULD be relying on others to help and teach us and it is putting all these things together as well as out own cognitive leaps and a little luck that earn us our keep.

I won’t lie, going through this course I have definitely felt, at times, that I might be in over my head. Sometimes new concepts can be challenging. Debugging broken code that’s not presenting as the actual error but as EVERYTHING can be frustrating. But after a few hundred errors fixed (at least), the pressure has begun to subside and my confidence is building. and in spite of the struggle and a little self-doubt I've yet to feel that in my case I might not fit. So, although I may have a lot to learn I'm realizing that in my case, when I'm behind the keyboard I am most definitely a software engineer.
