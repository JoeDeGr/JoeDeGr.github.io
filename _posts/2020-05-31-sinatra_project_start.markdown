"LADY MACBETH
Nought's had, all's spent,
Where our desire is got without content:
'Tis safer to be that which we destroy
Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy.

Enter MACBETH

How now, my lord! why do you keep alone,
Of sorriest fancies your companions making,
Using those thoughts which should indeed have died
With them they think on? Things without all remedy
Should be without regard: what's done is done. (3.2.4-12)"

I find it hardest of all to come up with a unique, interesting, credible, in demand idea for a new web site that I might like to design. So what do I do? Find my lady Mc.Beth who proclaims here "I want it all and I want it now!"

So I asked my daughter. 

She would like a place for her to make Faries and Wizards and Princesses... and maybe a game. So... Thats where I'll start. Maybe something will come of it.

What will we need? How will it work?

1. The user will log in with an email and password (secure).
2. The user will be brought to an index page or home page listing all their Faries, Wizards, and Princesses.
3. There will also be a link to create a new Farie, Wizard, or Princess.
4. If a Farie Wizard or Princess is selected they will be able to see the attribues of the charicter such as Name, Age, Desctiprion, Location, and magical powers. 
5. The create page will have fields to name the charicter, provide and age, a description (along with clothing), provide a location with a description, and provide a selection of magical powers with a description. Each of these will also have a "create" function to add a new selection.
6. Wants: sharing these. Uploading pictures. creating stories or games with friends.

Now to go map it out.
