I reached the CLI Data Gem project right about when the the Covid oubreak began in my area, so I mistakenly thought I'd have some extra time on my hands. What I didnt realize was all the other things I would have along with that time. Suffice to say there have been adjustments... all around. From having the kids at home and stepping up to home school, to all the preventative measure that add steps to every process from getting groceries to bringing in the mail this has been quite the experience. Oh, and I also thought it would be a great idea to set up my local environment for the first time with all this extra time I didnt realize I wouldnt have before I start the project.. and I have windows... Sufice to say this has been an adventure. 

On the bright side, the CLI Project has simotaniously tought me all the things I didnt know while simotanously forcing me to confidently attack the things that I do. It also forced me to think about object relationships with the GEM while planning then rethinking those same relationships during implimentation. It's been an amazing experience and, having to work during off hours with little help has been a pretty amazing lesson in self reliance as well as dilligent research and exploration. I actually really enjoyed doing all the brainstorming and pre-work then trying to get my CLI to work the way I envisioned. Following the reccomended steps, creating a notes file to work off of and seeing all the pieces in a flow chart realy helped gell the concepts from the module. a few more tweaks and this will be ready to present.

Setting up the local environment... now THAT was a bear and a half.  I ignorantly thought I could do this while watching the kids... "I'll just let them play... it will be FINE," I thought... RIGHT? HAHA well... when I tried and with the plethora of interuptions must have missed something when I tried to set my SSH key... well, lets just say I got to spend a more then a couple of hours figuring this one out. Thank the lord for friends who work for Google and could walk me through the process of locating said key and then I was off ... establishing the connection and getting my first push to Github.I learned more then a few things along the way and now I get to do it all over again on my desktop! 

Now on to completing my Data Gem project, which I had the pleasure of rebuilding due to what I endearingly call "tinny terrorist fingers" that mashed their way to deleting and adding endless lines of code in my files through keyboards left unattended while I chase spilled cups of juice, follow trails of crumbs to hiden treasure troves of half eaten snacks, and respond to pleas for help that even the coldest of hearts couldn't ignore... but I digress ... aaaaaand.... yup....I hear one now... So, until we meet again.
